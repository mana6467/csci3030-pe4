I could't find a partner, but I followed along with the instructions and did both branches and merged respectively, but I can understand any reduction in points as I didn't fully complete the programming exercise the way it was intended.

TicTacToe.cpp is a C++ implementation of the game tic-tac-toe. The players are asked to input the square they would like to mark (numbered 1-9), alternating between X's and O's every turn, until 9 turns have taken place (9 turns = 9 square spaces filled, assuming rules are followed).

To run TicTacToe.cpp simply use the created make file to create a tictactoe executable to run.
